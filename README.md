## Moviedux- React Project

Moviedux is a simple React website where users can explore movies from different genres and view basic information about each movie.
This project helped me learn React, components, props, state, and how to fetch/display data in a clean UI.

## Features:
 - Browse movies from different genres
 - View movie details such as:
     - Actors
     - Ratings
     - Movie information
 - Beginner-friendly UI
 - Fast development using Vite + React

## How to Run the Project:

1️) Install dependencies

npm install

2️) Start development server

npm run dev

3️) Open the link shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)
